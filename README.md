<--=Hi this is a Reference text about Why this project, Bugs Know and Info=-->

[sorry i don't know if my english are doing well  so it can have errors in the write]

Why this Project?? {
    so it all started with a project that i sugest to my Math Teacher About Cryptography for the School Science Fair , he likes the ideia and help and support the project.
    then i started to search on Github StackOverFlow and MDN to understand the UNICODE Base Conversion in JavaScript 
    i have to Searched in a Great Variate of Websites and with the help of a Great Programer Friend to understand and find some Cryptographes.
    so Why this Project ?? it was initialy an Project for my School Science Fair to Show a Little Demo About Cryptography but this Project is a Remastered Version of it that i want to continue with some improvements on Script and in my opinion the CSS 
}

Bugs Know?? {
    By Now i really don't found any bug, only if u use firefox and reload the HTML Localy u can do not clear the Inside Info but it can easily fixed if u clear the TextArea and Write in your Preferred Code
}

Info ?? {
    so... HTML Version is on 'Beta0.1' Cause i Probally will add just some improvements like clear button and more links to Cryptography and maybe if i found one or more errors
    The CSS Version in on 'AlphaPrototype0.1' it is a Prototype cause i don't know if i stil will Use it and alpha cause i stil need to learn mor about positions and improve the margins ETC
    The JavaScript Version is on 'Beta0.1' Cause i Probally will just add more Cryptography and see if it has any Problem in the code and maybe improve it in the future
    For Now That's All i think
