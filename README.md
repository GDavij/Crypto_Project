    so it all started with a project that i sugest to my Math Teacher About Cryptography for the School Science Fair , he likes the ideia and help and support the project.
    then i started to search on Github StackOverFlow and MDN to understand the UNICODE Base Conversion in JavaScript 
    i have to Searched in a Great Variate of Websites and with the help of a Great Programer Friend to understand and find some Cryptographes.
    so Why this Project ?? it was initialy an Project for my School Science Fair to Show a Little Demo About Cryptography but this Project is a Remastered Version of it that i want to continue with some improvements on Script and in my opinion the CSS
